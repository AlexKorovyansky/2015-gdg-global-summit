#GDG Global Summit

*This document is meant to capture notes, discussions and action items arising 
from the annual GDG Global Summit occuring before Google I/O.*

Prior to the Summit, we will identify the key talks/topics and create independent chapters
for each within this document. We will also identify *note takers* for each session, ideally 
from the participants of that session. 

Note takers will be responsible for editing the relevant chapter page of this book and will be 
required to have a GitHub account that they can use for contributions. GitBook uses 
[Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/) for formatting, so note takers 
should ideally be familiar with the format though it is fairly easy to pick up.

Other participants are encouraged to capture notes for later inclusion into this document as well.

At the conclusion of the summit, a small team of volunteers will do a final review, incorporating
additional content (e.g, other notes, pictures or links) and release the final version of the 
document to the GDG Global Community for feedback.
